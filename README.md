# Oddle Frontend Challenge

## Introduction
You will build a simpler version of GitHub [search console](https://github.com/search) website so that users can browse & explore. This website includes following 3 pages 

1. Search Page `/`: User can type in **username** and show a list of users 
2. Liked Page `/liked`: User can keep a list of **liked users** for future reference
3. User Detail Page `/users/:username`: User can know more about an individual user

This challenge is evaluated in following 3 aspects, [User Story](https://github.com/oddle-developer/oddle-frontend-challenge/blob/master/README.md#user-story), [Design Material](https://github.com/oddle-developer/oddle-frontend-challenge/blob/master/README.md#design-materials) and [Technical Requirements](https://github.com/oddle-developer/oddle-frontend-challenge/blob/master/README.md#technical-requirements). 

Each aspect will have **basic** (required for submission) & **bonus** (optional) sections
